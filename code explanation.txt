Explanation of Key Sections:
Imports:

Libraries like cv2, mediapipe, math, numpy, and screen_brightness_control are imported to handle video, hand detection, distance calculation, interpolation, and brightness adjustment, respectively.
Hand Detection Model:

The mp.solutions.hands class initializes the Mediapipe hand detection model, with parameters for tracking confidence, detection confidence, and maximum hands.
Video Capture:

The cv2.VideoCapture(0) object starts video streaming from the default webcam.
Frame Processing:

The frame is flipped for a natural mirror view and converted to RGB for Mediapipe processing.
Landmark Detection:

Mediapipe detects landmarks for each hand in the frame, and their pixel coordinates are calculated relative to the frame size.
Brightness Control:

The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated using the hypot function, and the brightness level is mapped to a range of 0-100 using np.interp.
Display and Exit:

The processed frame is displayed using cv2.imshow. Pressing 'q' exits the loop, releases the webcam, and closes all OpenCV windows.
